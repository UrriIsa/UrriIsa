## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Isaac Urrutia (Also known simply as Urri), a computer science student, but it's not my only passion.
The topics i interested are the biotechnology, nanoscience and computational neuroscience. And others related with other knowledge areas, like the art.

This account contains many of my projects, most carried out throughout my degree, but there are also my own projects and challenges, so enjoy it.
