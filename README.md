## Hi ðŸ§Š

I'm Isaac Urrutia (also known simply as Urri), a computer science student, but it's not my only passion.
The topics i interested are the biotechnology, bioinformatics, nanoscience, computational neuroscience, theoretical biology and theoretical computer science. And others related with other knowledge areas, like the art.

This account contains many of my projects, most carried out throughout my degree, but there are also my own projects and challenges, so enjoy it. 

**Note:** This is my general/testing GitHub account for academic projects, experiments and side-challenges.
